<h2 id="writer-and-teacher">WRITER AND TEACHER</h2>

<p>My writing has appeared in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/10/viatical-settlements-aids-gay-men/572044/"><em>The Atlantic</em></a>, <a href="https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/the-art-of-protest/"><em>The Times Literary Supplement</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theawl.com/2017/04/why-not-live-with-friends/"><em>The Awl</em></a>. I’m currently working on a book about <a href="https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/the-art-of-protest/">Gran Fury</a>, a collective of artists associated with ACT UP. (The AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power). I also teach in the Undergraduate Writing Program at Columbia University. If you want to hear my voice, you can listen to my interview with Kai Ryssdal for NPR’s <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2018/10/15/business/how-unregulated-life-insurance-policies-profited-deaths-gay-men">Marketplace</a>.</p>
