## WRITER AND TEACHER

My writing has appeared in [_The Atlantic_](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/10/viatical-settlements-aids-gay-men/572044/), [_The Times Literary Supplement_](https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/the-art-of-protest/) and [_The Awl_](https://www.theawl.com/2017/04/why-not-live-with-friends/). I’m currently working on a book about [Gran Fury](https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/the-art-of-protest/), a collective of artists associated with [ACT UP](https://google.com) (The AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power). I also teach in the Undergraduate Writing Program at Columbia University. If you want to hear my voice, you can listen to my interview with Kai Ryssdal for NPR’s [Marketplace](https://www.marketplace.org/2018/10/15/business/how-unregulated-life-insurance-policies-profited-deaths-gay-men).
